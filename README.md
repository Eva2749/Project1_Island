# Project1_Island
Imagine you accidentally landed on an island that was beautiful but also bare and dangerous, what would you do and think? If you've read novels like Robinson Crusoe, you probably would have a picture of what it's like. But this island is probably more mysterious than you think. Let's dive into it using VR and EXPLORE and IMAGINE!

Just follow what you think intrigues you and the hidden story will unfold naturally in your imagination. The log cabin is a good way to start exploring. The fingerprint will be your guide as well. See where they can lead you to!
