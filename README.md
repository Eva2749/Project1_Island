# Project1_Island
Imagine you accidentally landed on an island that was beautiful but also bare and dangerous, what would you do and think? If you've read novels like Robinson Crusoe, you probably would have a picture of what it's like. The "isolated uninhabited island" concept is always intriguing to me. On the other hand, I'm also a person who's very much into Japanese aesthetics. That's how my idea of creating a beautiful yet dangerous/bleak island comes into my mind.
